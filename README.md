# Olist Ecommerce Project
Set up Azure resources to ingest raw data from GitHub and MySQL into Data Lake, process and join it in Databricks with MongoDB data, and store the final outputs for downstream use.

Olist E-commerce Data Pipeline for E-commerce Analytics
I built a modern data engineering workflow combining multiple data sources and technologies:

1. Azure Data Factory ingests raw CSV data dynamically from GitHub and MySQL into Azure Data Lake.
2. Databricks processes and cleans the data, enriching it further by connecting to MongoDB.
3. Transformed datasets are stored back in Data Lake.

Key Steps in the Pipeline:
1. Set up Azure resources (Data Factory, Data Lake Storage, Databricks)
2. Ingest raw data from GitHub and MySQL into Data Lake
3. Clean, transform, and join datasets in Databricks
4. Integrate additional data from MongoDB
5. Store the final processed data for downstream use

Technologies used: Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Azure Data Lake, MySQL, MongoDB.
